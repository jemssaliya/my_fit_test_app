## Installation

This package is intended to be installed on a **new Laravel project**. You'll be able to install it on an existing project, but might need to change some configuration settings.


1) Create a new Laravel project and go to the directory
```
composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel [project-name]
cd [project-name]
```


2) Update `composer.json`. 

This package and some dependent packages are available in private repositories. Change the `repositories` section to add the new repository, or create a new section in the file.

```
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@bitbucket.org:elegantmedia/oxygen-laravel.git"
        },
        {
            "type":"vcs",
            "url":"git@bitbucket.org:elegantmedia/multitenant-laravel.git"
        },
        {
            "type":"vcs",
            "url":"git@bitbucket.org:elegantmedia/lotus.git"
        },
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@bitbucket.org:elegantmedia/formation.git"
        },
        {
            "type":"vcs",
            "url":"git@bitbucket.org:elegantmedia/laravel-app-settings.git"
        },
        {
            "type":"vcs",
            "url":"git@bitbucket.org:elegantmedia/laravel-generators.git"
        },
        {
            "type":"vcs",
            "url":"git@bitbucket.org:elegantmedia/quickdata-laravel.git"
        },
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@bitbucket.org:elegantmedia/laravel-helpers.git"
        },
        {
            "type": "vcs",
            "url": "git@bitbucket.org:elegantmedia/php-helpers.git"
        }
    ],
```

3) Require the package into composer through the command line.
```
composer require emedia/oxygen
```

4) Edit `.env` file and update the database settings.

5) Commit your current state to Git, because next step will change some of the default files.

```
git init
git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit."
```

6) Run the following command. This will do the default installation, if any questions are asked, you can just press ENTER to confirm the default choice, or change it.

```
php artisan setup:oxygen-project
```

(OPTIONAL) The default setup will install with default options. If you want to have manual control over installation run the command `php artisan setup:oxygen-project --confirm` and it will confirm before every step.

7) After the setup is done, you'll see the next steps on screen. These build instructions will be also added to your `README.md` file.

8) Go and make something amazing!

## Developer Commands

These commands are available from the CLI.

#### Create a new user

Create a new user and assign a role.
```
php artisan setup:create-user
```

#### Scaffold Views

Create the default views for a given resource.

```
php artisan scaffold:views
OR
php artisan scaffold:views --path=<resource.path>

Example:
php artisan scaffold:views --path=manage.users
```

This will create the default views within `resources/views/manage/users`, or in the path that you specify.


## Helper Functions

```
// 08/Oct/2018 10:27 PM
{{ standard_datetime($item->created_at) }}

// 08/Oct/2018
{{ standard_date($item->created_at) }}

// 10:27 PM
{{ standard_time($item->created_at) }}
```

## Middleware

### Access Control Lists (ACL) Middleware

Oxygen comes with an access control middleware based on roles and/or permissions. You can use the middleware for advanced permission based access control for routes, controllers or functions.

To use the middleware, use `auth.acl`.

```
Usage:

// User must have at least `owner` OR `admin` AND the permission `do-something`
auth.acl:roles[owner|admin],permissions[do-something]

// User must have at least `owner` OR `admin`
auth.acl:roles[owner|admin]

// User must have the permission `do-something`
auth.acl:permissions[do-something]

// User must have both permissions. `do-something` AND `do-another-thing`
auth.acl:permissions[do-something|do-another-thing]	

// User must have at least one permission `do-something` OR `do-something-else`
auth.acl:permissions[do-something OR do-something-else]
```

### API Key Check Middleware

Call the `auth.api` middleware to verify API keys before hitting specific routes. The middleware will look for `X-Api-Key` field in HTTP header. 

You should provide the valid API Keys in the `.env` file.

```
Example in .env file:
API_KEY="123123123"
OR
API_KEY="123123123,APIKEY2"
```


### Reserved Variables in Blade Templates

These are the reserved variables in Blade templates. These variables should not be used to assign other data.

Blade Variables
```
{{-- Current logged in User is available with $user by default --}}
{{ $user->name }}

{{-- Current page title. `My Account` by default --}}
{{ $pageTitle }}

{{-- Current app name --}}
{{ $appName }}
```

## Must Read Instructions

Oxygen by default has a lot of built-in functions. Please read all the docs to understand all features. Otherwise you'll be spending a lot of time re-doing existing features.

- [Resource, Model, Repository, Controller Generation](https://bitbucket.org/elegantmedia/laravel-generators/src/master/README.md)
- [Roles and Permissions - Bouncer](https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer)
- [Database Reset Commands](https://bitbucket.org/elegantmedia/laravel-helpers/src/master/README.md)
- [PHP Helper Functions](https://bitbucket.org/elegantmedia/php-helpers/src/master/README.md)
- [App Settings Handling](https://bitbucket.org/elegantmedia/laravel-app-settings/src/master/README.md)
- [Breadcrumbs, Page Titles, Tables, Pagination, Empty State and other Html Elements](https://bitbucket.org/elegantmedia/lotus/src/master/README.md)

## After Installation

- You can add new features to existing controllers as needed. 
- If you need to change the default behaviour, you can create new classes or extend from the classes in the `Oxygen` package.


### Customisations

#### How to Overwrite Views After Installation
If you want to publish the views after the installation, run
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="EMedia\Oxygen\OxygenServiceProvider" --tag=views --force
```

## FAQs

#### I got an error while installing, what do to?

Probably it's a conflict with an previously partially completed setup. If this happens, rollback everything to the commit at Step #5, and try the steps from there again.

```
// use this command to hard reset all files and remove any new files - NEVER DO THIS ON A LIVE SERVER!
git reset --hard && git clean -fd
```

#### How to Change the User model

1 . On `config/auth.php`, change `providers.users.model` OR add a new line,
```
	'model'	=> '\Auth\NewUserClass',
```

2 . On `AppServiceProvider.php` and `boot` method, change as below,
```
public function boot()
{
    \Silber\Bouncer\Database\Models::setUsersModel(NewUserClass::class);
}
``` 

#### What are the logins?

Your default user login password is listed in the `database/seeds/Auth/UsersTableSeeder.php` file.
